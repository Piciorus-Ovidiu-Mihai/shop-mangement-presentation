# 💻 Shop Management Application
The app’s main purpose is to connect the main store chains to their clients in a more efficient and time saving way. It serves as a digital portal between the buyers and the actual physical store, and the whole package of functionalities of an online store, such as a cart to place your products, descriptions and reviews, a home page, a contact page, and an order history page.
So, if it has all the features of an ordinary online shop, what is something new that it brings? Well first of all, the users begin their search in the app by creating a new list in which they introduce specific keywords related to the desired products. Then they can select their favorite stores from which they want to get these products from. Based on these selections, a list will be created with the best products, based on their quality and price. 
The application is hosted on 🌍[App](https://shopmanagement-af64b.web.app/).
Also for the mobile app the source code can be found on 📱[Mobile](https://github.com/Piciorus-Ovidiu-Mihai/ShopManagement/tree/main/shop-management-android).
